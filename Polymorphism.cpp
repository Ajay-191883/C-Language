// - one name and multiple forms
// Two types --> Complile-time & Run-time Polymorphism
//% Compile-time-->(Early or Static Binding) ---> Compiler binds variables to function in compile time like in Function or Operator overloading.
//% Run-time---> (Late binding) ---> there is no binding happens in variables and function, actually in run time program choose which code(function) to run by looking type of pointer, like in Virtual function
